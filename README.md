data.table provides a high-performance and programmer-friendly version
of Râ€™s `data.frame`. It makes it easy to perform grouped summaries and
perform flexible joins (including ordered, rolling, and overlapping
range joins), and is optimised for high-performance on large data sets,
using parallelism and indices to make code as fast as possible.
data.table has no external dependencies and relies only on R 3.1.0,
making it well suited for use in production.

data.table also includes `fread()` for fast and friendly file reading,
`fwrite()` for fast file writing, and a collection of functions for fast
and convenient vectorised operations including `frank()`, `froll()`, and
`forder()`.

data.table is widely used by the R community. As of July 2019, it was
used by over 680 CRAN and Bioconductor packages and was the [9th most
starred](http://www.r-pkg.org/starred) R package on GitHub. If you need
help, the data.table community is active StackOverflow, with nearly
[9,000 questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data.table).
