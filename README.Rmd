`data.table` provides a high-performance and programmer-friendly version of R's `data.frame`. It makes it easy to perform grouped summaries and perform flexible joins (including ordered, rolling, and overlapping range joins), and is optimised for high-performance on large in-memory data sets, using parallelism and indices to make code as fast as possible. `data.table` has no external dependencies and relies only on R 3.1.0, making it well-suited for use in production.

`data.table` also includes `fread()` for fast and friendly file reading, `fwrite()` for fast file writing, and a collection of functions for fast and convenient vectorised operations including `frank()`, `froll()`, and `forder()`.

`data.table` is widely used by the R community. As of July 2019, it was used by over 680 CRAN and Bioconductor packages and was the [9th most starred](http://www.r-pkg.org/starred) R package on GitHub. If you need help, the `data.table` community is active StackOverflow, with nearly [9,000 questions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/data.table).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `data.table` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("data.table")
```

See [the Installation wiki](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Installation) for instructions on installing the development version.

## Example

`data.table` syntax is concise & designed to mimic that of `data.frame`s. You can "query" your `data.table` (generically named `DT`) using `[` and three essential arguments:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
DT[i, j, by]
```

 - `i` is for selecting or sorting _rows_ (related ideas: SQL's `WHERE` clause, row filtering, SQL's `ORDER BY` clause)
 - `j` is for selecting, updating or operating on _columns_ (related ideas: SQL's `SELECT` clause)
 - `by` (optional) is for specifying _groups_ over which to run `j` (related ideas: SQL's `GROUP BY` clause)

Here is an example ...

``` r
library(data.table)
## basic example code
```
